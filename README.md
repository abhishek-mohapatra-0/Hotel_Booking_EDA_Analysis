# Hotel_Booking_EDA_Analysis

                       ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Data Analysis Project! ðŸš€

I recently completed an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data, uncovering fascinating insights into guest behaviors and preferences. This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my data science skills to real-world data and derive actionable insights. Here are some of the key highlights:

# Project Title: Hotel Booking Data Analysis

Key Objectives:
> Perform Spatial Analysis on Guests' Home-Towns
Determine the geographic origins of guests and analyze spatial trends.                                                
Analyze Room Pricing
Evaluate how much guests pay per night and how pricing varies over the year.
Understand Guest Preferences
Identify what guests prefer in terms of meals and special requests.
Examine Seasonal Trends
Identify the busiest months and analyze the distribution of nights spent at hotels by market segment and hotel type.
Cancellation Analysis
Determine the number of cancellations and identify the months with the highest cancellation rates.
Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and creating informative plots.
Geopandas: For spatial data analysis.
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and modeling.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Average Daily Rate (ADR): The average revenue earned per occupied room.
Occupancy Rate: The percentage of available rooms that are occupied.
Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): A measure of room revenue performance.
Booking Cancellation Rate: The percentage of bookings that were cancelled.
Length of Stay: The average duration of guest stays.
Market Segment Distribution: The proportion of bookings from different market segments.
Models and Graphs:
Time Series Analysis:
Plotted ADR trends over the year to identify seasonal pricing patterns.
Spatial Analysis:
Used Geopandas to map the geographic distribution of guests' home-towns.
Distribution Plots:
Created histograms and KDE plots to visualize the distribution of nights spent by guests and the distribution of bookings by market segment.
Bar Charts:
Analyzed special requests and meal preferences using bar charts.
Heatmaps:
Generated heatmaps to show correlation between different features.
Key Insights:
Geographic Origins:
Analyzed the home-towns of guests to identify key source markets.
Room Pricing Trends:
Detailed analysis of pricing variations across different times of the year.
Guest Preferences:
Insights into meal preferences and common special requests made by guests.
Seasonal Occupancy:
Identified peak months for hotel bookings and examined the length of stay for different market segments.
Cancellation Patterns:
Revealed the months with the highest cancellation rates and potential reasons behind this trend.
This project not only sharpened my analytical skills but also provided valuable insights that can help hotel management teams optimize their operations and marketing strategies.
